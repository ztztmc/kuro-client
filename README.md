## Usage
A launcher for this client will be available soon.
For now, you have to install it manually.
- Go to [legacyfabric.net/downloads](https://legacyfabric.net/downloads.html)
- Download and setup legacy fabric
- Go to the [releases section](https://github.com/ztztmc/kuro-client/releases) and download the latest kuro_client.jar
- Get [legacy-fabric-api.jar](https://github.com/Legacy-Fabric/fabric/releases/tag/1.12.0)
- Put both jars into %appdata%/.minecraft/mods (make sure there are no other mods, you can only use [mods supported by legacy fabric](https://legacyfabric.net/mods.html))
- Run Minecraft with the Legacy Fabric version/installation.
To get optifine, you will need to add [optifine](https://optifine.net/adloadx?f=OptiFine_1.8.9_HD_U_M5.jar) and [legacy optifabric](https://modrinth.com/mod/legacy-optifabric?version=1.8.9&loader=legacy-fabric#download) into the mods folder.
